     </div>
        <p>In our first theme of the semester, we learned about different layout principles, but most importantly, we were introduced to the basics of HTML and CSS in order to
         code our first responsive website. <br>Long story short, we covered basic web design from research and ideation to design and development for the web.</p>

        <h2>Basic Animation</h2>
         <p>Concepts of basic animation, classic storytelling and character design.</p>

                <p>This is the simple animation task we did, it allowed us to explore the javascript functions. There were some challenges but as the theme progressed we began to learn from our mistakes and improved.</p>
                <br>
                <button onclick="window.location.href=''" class="button">02.02.01 Week submission</button>
                <p>03.02.01 Week submission: This task challenged our abilities to create an animation that can follow a story. Thus, each individual had the creative freedom of developing a short story including a protagonist and antagonist while targeting dramaturgical elements. I created my characters using Adobe Illustrator CC 2018</p>

                <p>03.03.02 Interactive animation: this task was similar to the week submission, however this time we could work in pairs to use inspiration from existing fairytales and short stories to create a dynamic animation.</p>

                      <p>02.01.07 Storyboard: We couldn't create a story without visualisation, therefore we made a representation of our production. We included the frames, duration and movement. We thought about the use of space and lighting and what audio and sound effects can be utilised to create more dynamic.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Design Sprint was a five day process. We were presented with a client; Fredrikke - Head of Multimedia Design and Communication. The subject concerned improveing the current univeristy learning management portal "Fronter". Our task as UX designers was to identify the uses of, problems with and potential solutions for - Fronter. Therefore, I created my "ideal" fronter through using an XD Prototype.</p>

                <button onclick="window.location.href=''" class="button">04.02.01. Web prototype</button>
                <p>This task involved group work. All members discussed based on the client's opinion, strategies and steps necessary to create an effective learning management system. Our goal's primary focus was a multi-way communication system. This web prototype was a coded template of what our app would look like. It is a mobile only version.</p>

                <p>04.03.01. Native app: The main goal that we set while creating our solution was to make a learning management app that would provide great user experience to the students. Every student has different priorities, that is why we decided to focus on a cutomisable homescreen, to meet user expectations.</p>
